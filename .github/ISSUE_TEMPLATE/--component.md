# Usage Norm

These component issues track less glorious items that can be cleanly scoped. They are the building blocks of features.

Defining components can greatly improve workflow, by helping shape priorities and the best path forward. A difficult component would warrant extra scrutiny- drawing effort to look for a better or simpler approach. Alternatively, a more costly component might end up being preferred if it can yield better long term benefits.
