<!-- Include a one sentence description -->

Bugs are auto-assigned

## Purpose

<!-- Concisely explain how this will speed up or improve workflow -->
<!-- Personal sentiments should be in a quote -->

Instead of having a meeting about this it will just get given directly.

## Design

<!-- explain the method or behavioral change to establish the new norm -->

Configure Github to auto assign based off of labels

## Do

<!-- list of things to complete and validate -->
<!-- if the method doesn't literally remove manual work, establish how it can be validated-->

- [ ] label `bug` randomly assigns

## Don't
<!-- optional list to call out negatives or pitfalls -->

- [ ] all the bugs don't mysteriously assign to the intern



<!-- 

# Usage Norm

Code bases also need to be maintained, not just built. Vulnerabilities may be discovered, or optimization, or just good old refactoring to make the code base easier to understand and support.

Being agile demands 2 things: initially not over-designing, and reflection. It's the art of taking it one step at a time towards your goal, but it relies highly heavily on looking back and making corrections using what was learned. Acknowledge that the process is not *finding perfect solutions* but rather *finding better solutions.*
