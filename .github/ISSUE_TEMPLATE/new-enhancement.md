Add a Thing Doer

## Purpose

<!-- explain the purpose -->
<!-- Tone should be objective, but can include opinionated sentiments in a quote block. -->

There are many things that need to be done. Having a thing to do the little things is needed.

> I like it more when things are done, because it is more interesting.

## Design

<!-- list of 1 or more example. -->
<!-- psuedo code for high level concepts, but be technical when needed. -->
<!-- alternatively, provide pictures / screen shots -->

```javascript
class ThingDoer{
  does(thing)

  things[]  // tracks all things
}
```

## Do
<!-- List of things needed to be completed -->

- [ ] this done
- [ ] that done

## Don't
<!-- optional list to call out negative validations or pitfalls -->

- [ ] after `thingDoer` runs nothing is undone



<!-- 

# Usage Norm

Likely `component` issues will be created to identify and construct underlying pieces needed to facilitate the enhancement.
